<h1>Checkerboard</h1>

<p>This was an assignment for Coding Dojo to help understand the concept of routes in flask.<br>
  The idea is that the root route will provide an 8x8 checkerboard in red and black.<br>
  The user can add "/y" or "/y/x" to the url to change the number of rows on the board, where y is the number of rows the user specifies vertically, and x is the number of rows the user specifies horizontally.<br>
  After adding "/y/x" to the url, the user can also add "/color1" or "/color1/color2" where color1 changes the color of the black squares and the title on the page, and color2 changes the color of the red squares.
